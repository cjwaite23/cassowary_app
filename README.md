# cassowary_app
Cassowaries play an important ecological role in dispersing seeds through rainforest, especially in areas where tropical rainforest patches are fragmented.  

This Shiny app uses data from the [Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au) to map occurrences of the Southern Cassowary (*Casuarius casuarius*) in Queensland, as well as records of fifteen plant species known to be dispersed by cassowaries.
